<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

* Internal navbar links (Why Us and Step-by-step) are not accessible when user has logged in.
* Footer is not displayed on pages when the user donÂ´t need to scroll. The footer only appears on pages where users need to scroll.

<h3 id="solved-bugs">Solved Bugs</h3>

* Redirecting to right page when user has logged in
I had i main issue that user was not redirected to the right page based on the user type. I was able to solve that issue with a custom view and defining the get user type, the redirected to the right url based on user type.

* Toggle collapse inside a for loop in template
A bootstrap collapse is used for displaying both the order and candidate for the customer. There was a main issue that every collapse opened when i toggled it. I solved it with some custom javascript code to target the nearest element when the user toggled.

* Navbar links on mobile
The navbar is separated into different lists based on if they are authenticated and when logged in, which user type. All logged in links are pushed to the right and first i did that with position fixed. Therefore the internal (logged in) links what not displaying in navbar on smaller devices.
I solved that with some custom CSS so the position is fixed down to 991px when the collapse navbar appears, then the position fixed is removed.

* Change of toggler color icon for Bootstrap navbar
I struggled a lot with changing the color of the toggler icon into the navbar. Then i found [This](https://www.folkstalk.com/2022/09/bootstrap-navbar-toggler-icon-color-with-code-examples.html) and understood that I needed to change the url for the icon.

### The story of Mats and The Factory
Mats is a hard-working manager at Svenska Industrigruppen AB.

He started his career there as a 16-year-old, then as a summer worker, and for 30 years has had various roles at the factory that refines metal for several large Swedish companies. Mats is fairly new in his role as a leader but enjoys it very much, and according to the company's latest employee surveys, he seems to be doing a really good job.

His biggest concern is when they need to hire new staff. Since it's a big decision and something that could cost the company a lot of money if it goes wrong, he feels some anxiety. The factory's production is very variable, and that makes it very difficult to plan how much staff is needed in production while it can change quickly, and in 14 days they will need five extra people to be able to produce at maximum level.

That evening, Mats remembers the nice guy who stopped by the factory a few weeks ago and picks up the business card to go to their website. He creates a user and enters the specifications for the resources he requires, then sends the request and goes to bed.

Already at lunch the next day, Mats has received two notices that there are candidates presented on the website, and he logs in. He looks at the candidates' CVs and the company's offer, the price is also reasonable for what he is looking for. He makes contact with responsible managers and books them in for an interview at the factory. 

Over the course of a few days, he receives more candidates on the website, and he chooses to meet a few more. Within 14 days, Mats has managed to find five consultants who enable the factory to deliver at the highest possible capacity. 
Mats is satisfied.

For a better understand how the flow of both a customer and partner should look, i´ve made a flowchart to describe the flow of a user from that they are visiting the application to that they have made the first request or send their first candidate.

## The Surface Plane

### Base
To make the application as dynamic as possible i want the navbar and footer to be the same in all of the application. Therefore Django dynamic pages is used so the user always recognise the default layout there on.

Navbar
![navbar](./readme-files/images/surface/navbar.png)

Footer
![footer](./readme-files/images/surface/footer.png)

### Homepage
A big goal is to highlight the advantages as early as possible so the user gets sold on why the should register and use our application. Two call to action is being displayed in the hero image to encurage the user to do something, either sign up or read more.

The three biggest advantages of using our service is being displayed under the hero image. On desktop the user get a hint about them and gets curious to read more.

![hero](./readme-files/images/surface/hero.png)

When the user scrolls down they can see some more advantages in combination with a sneakpeak how the application looks on a laptop. Also here we have a call to action to encourage the user to do something.

![mockup and cta](./readme-files/images/surface/text-with-button.png)

So far we have focused on the user (Customer) and thats because the main market must be to the customer to do requests in the application. We know that if we fills the database with a lot of request, the partner will come to us to find new business opportunities.

![partner cta](./readme-files/images/surface/partner-cta.png)

After that we focus on the partner on the homepage and display a Call-to-action for the partner to register a account.

![step-by-step](./readme-files/images/surface/step-by-step.png)

The Step-by-step explains in details how the applications works and we want to show that to attract the user who want to understand more before making a decision. 

![quote](./readme-files/images/surface/quote.png)

and as a last intention to get the user to signup we display a quote “If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always got.”.
Just to get the user to think in a different approach and signup to our application. We display a back-to-top button so the user don´t have to scroll up to register.

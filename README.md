<h2 id="target-group">Target Group</h2>
Jobin Application has two target groups, customers, and partners.
By focusing marketing on customers, we are confident that we will attract many partners to our application. Consulting companies are always looking for new business opportunities and those opportunities are with us when customers post requests in our application.

### Customers
The consultant industry has annual turnover of trillions of dollars worldwide. Companies in almost every country in the world are spending money on consulting hours, many of them with low satisfaction. Jobin is an application for the thousands of companies that want to find the absolute best quality of the consultants they invest in, by comparing their options before making a decision.

### Partners
In Sweden, two new consulting companies are registered a week (statistics from 2021). There have never been so many companies fighting for the same customers. With our application, our partners can focus on their core business, hiring quality consultants, instead of having to spend time selling their services to clients. Whoever has the best consultant gets to deliver

<h2 id="user-experince">UXD - User Experince Design</h2>
To better understand the customer journey i made a story about how a customer journey could look.

For base of the project i´ve made wireframes based on the user stories and the flowchart of customer/partner.


<h3 id="storytelling">The story of Mats and The Factory</h3>
Mats is a hard-working manager at Svenska Industrigruppen AB.

He started his career there as a 16-year-old, then as a summer worker, and for 30 years has had various roles at the factory that refines metal for several large Swedish companies. Mats is fairly new in his role as a leader but enjoys it very much, and according to the company's latest employee surveys, he seems to be doing a really good job.

His biggest concern is when they need to hire new staff. Since it's a big decision and something that could cost the company a lot of money if it goes wrong, he feels some anxiety. The factory's production is very variable, and that makes it very difficult to plan how much staff is needed in production while it can change quickly, and in 14 days they will need five extra people to be able to produce at maximum level.

That evening, Mats remembers the nice guy who stopped by the factory a few weeks ago and picks up the business card to go to their website. He creates a user and enters the specifications for the resources he requires, then sends the request and goes to bed.

Already at lunch the next day, Mats has received two notices that there are candidates presented on the website, and he logs in. He looks at the candidates' CVs and the company's offer, the price is also reasonable for what he is looking for. He makes contact with responsible managers and books them in for an interview at the factory. 

Over the course of a few days, he receives more candidates on the website, and he chooses to meet a few more. Within 14 days, Mats had managed to find five consultants who enabled the factory to deliver at the highest possible capacity.
Mats are satisfied.

<h3 id="flowchart">Flowchart</h3> 
For a better understanding of how the flow of both a customer and partner should look, i´ve made a flowchart to describe the flow of a user from that they are visiting the application to that they have made the first request or sent their first candidate.

* As a User I can Edit my requests so that the request displays the correct information in case of some changes are made.
* As a User I can delete my request so that partners do not spend time presenting candidates if we have already found what we are looking for.


* As a User/Partner I can see information about the website/tool so that I understand why i should register an account.
* As a Partner I can register an account so that I can see consultant requests from companies.

<h2 id="surface-plan">The Surface Plane</h2>

<h3 id="base">Base</h3>
To make the application as dynamic as possible, i want the navbar and footer to be the same in all of the application. Therefore, Django dynamic pages are used so the user always recognizes the default layout they're on.

Navbar
![navbar](./readme-files/images/surface/navbar.png)

Footer
![footer](./readme-files/images/surface/footer.png)

<h3 id="homepage">Homepage</h3>
A big goal is to highlight the advantages as early as possible so the user gets sold on why they should register and use our application. Two call-to action buttons are displayed in the hero image to encourage the user to do something; either sign up or read more.

The three biggest advantages of using our service are being displayed under the hero image. On desktop the user gets a hint about them and gets curious to read more.

![hero](./readme-files/images/surface/hero.png)

When the user scrolls down, they can see some more advantages in combination with a sneakpeak of how the application looks on a laptop. Also here we have a call to action to encourage the user to do something.

![mockup and cta](./readme-files/images/surface/text-with-button.png)

So far we have focused on the user (Customer) and that's because the main market must be the customer to do requests in the application. We know that if we fill the database with a lot of requests, the partner will come to us to find new business opportunities.

![partner cta](./readme-files/images/surface/partner-cta.png)

After that we focus on the partner on the homepage and display a Call-to-action for the partner to register an account.

![step-by-step](./readme-files/images/surface/step-by-step.png)

The step-by-step explains in details how the applications work and we want to show that to attract the user who want to understand more before making a decision.

![quote](./readme-files/images/surface/quote.png)

And as a last intention to get the user to signup, we display a quote “If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always got.”.
Just to get the user to think in a different approach and signup to our application. We display a back-to-top button so the user don´t have to scroll up to register.


<h3 id="signup">Signup</h3>
The user is using the same signup page and chooses type of account, customer or partner, due to which type of account they will use.

![signup](./readme-files/images/surface/signup.png)


<h3 id="login">Login</h3>
Its easy to login for returning user. Just fill in your username and password and you get logged in.

![login](./readme-files/images/surface/login.png)


<h3 id="customer-overview">Customer Overview</h3>
When a user has signed up or logged in as a customer, they get redirected to the user/overview page. On this page they can find a call to action to make a new request. This is also the main page for the customer where they can see all their requests and also candidates on every request.

![user-overview](./readme-files/images/surface/user-overview.png)

![request-details](./readme-files/images/surface/request-details.png)


<h3 id="new-request">New Request</h3>
When the user clicks on the button to make a new request, they get redirected to a form to fill in the details about the request.

![new-request](./readme-files/images/surface/new-request.png)


<h3 id="edit-request">Edit Request</h3>
From the overview the user can see the request and click on edit request if they need to make some changes on the request.

![buttons](./readme-files/images/surface/buttons.png)

![edit-request](./readme-files/images/surface/edit-request.png)


<h3 id="delete-request">Delete Request</h3>
On the overview, the customer can also choose to delete the request.

![buttons](./readme-files/images/surface/buttons.png)

![delete-request](./readme-files/images/surface/delete-request.png)


<h3 id="partner-overview">Partner Overview</h3>
When the partner has signed up or logged in, they get redirected to the main request overview where they can see all requests that's being active. If they click on the request, they can see details about that specific request.

![partner overview](./readme-files/images/surface/partner-overview.png)

![overview details](./readme-files/images/surface/overview-details.png)


<h3 id="send-candidates">Send Candidates</h3>
The partner can see information about the request and when they have a candidate that suits the request, they can present the candidate to the customer.

![present-candidate](./readme-files/images/surface/present-candidate.png)


<h3 id="see-candidates">See Candidates</h3>
When the customer has presented the candidate, the user can see that candidate presented on their request. Compare with all the candidates that's being presented and choose which one suits their needs the best. If they want to schedule an interview, they can contact the manager by email.

![see-candidate](./readme-files/images/surface/see-candidates.png)

<h2 id="database-design">Database Design</h2>
On this project postgresql is used with ElephantSQL

[Database Diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpliee0fu/image/upload/v1669761371/Database_Planning_gzhnzg.pdf)


### Key Models

### User

* The user profile is connected to the User model created by Allauth on registration.
* The model is extended with AbstractUser to be able to save different user types with different permissions.
* Primary Key is the id which is genereated automatically when a user is created.

### Order

* The order model is related to the user model to see who is responsible for the order.
* If the user is deleted, the order also gets deleted so no orders are active for users that don´t exist.

### Candidate

* Candidates are related to their managers (Users) who "create" the candidate.
* Candidates are also related to the order in which managers present the candidate and link them together.
* Being linked to the order, the user can also get access to the Candidate information via the template.

## The story of Mats and The Factory
Mats is a hard-working manager at Svenska Industrigruppen AB.

He started his career there as a 16-year-old, then as a summer worker, and for 30 years has had various roles at the factory that refines metal for several large Swedish companies. Mats is fairly new in his role as a leader but enjoys it very much, and according to the company's latest employee surveys, he seems to be doing a really good job.

His biggest concern is when they need to hire new staff. Since it's a big decision and something that could cost the company a lot of money if it goes wrong, he feels some anxiety. The factory's production is very variable, and that makes it very difficult to plan how much staff is needed in production while it can change quickly, and in 14 days they will need five extra people to be able to produce at maximum level.

That evening, Mats remembers the nice guy who stopped by the factory a few weeks ago and picks up the business card to go to their website. He creates a user and enters the specifications for the resources he requires, then sends the request and goes to bed.

Already at lunch the next day, Mats has received two notices that there are candidates presented on the website, and he logs in. He looks at the candidates' CVs and the company's offer, the price is also reasonable for what he is looking for. He makes contact with responsible managers and books them in for an interview at the factory. 

Over the course of a few days, he receives more candidates on the website, and he chooses to meet a few more. Within 14 days, Mats has managed to find five consultants who enable the factory to deliver at the highest possible capacity. 
Mats is satisfied.
